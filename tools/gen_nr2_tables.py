"""Generate the NR2 gain-table blob from WDSP's `calculus.c`.

WDSP's NR2 (`emnr.c`, gain method 2) does not evaluate its gain rule at run
time: it looks the answer up in two 241x241 tables, `GG` and `GGS`, generated
offline by Warren Pratt and shipped as ~3 MB of C source. The estimator's
closed form is not in WDSP — only the sampled result — so a port either copies
the tables or invents a different gain rule, and a different gain rule is a
different denoiser. We copy them, transcoded to little-endian `f32`.

    python3 tools/gen_nr2_tables.py ~/Development/wdsp

`f32` rather than the source's `f64` because the round-trip error is 5e-8,
five orders of magnitude below the ~0.4 % the 0.25 dB grid and its bilinear
interpolation cost anyway. Uncompressed because deflate only reaches 0.74 here
(smooth float surfaces), and the 117 KiB that would save does not buy a new
dependency in `sdroxide-dsp` the way JS8's 12x did in `sdroxide-digi`.

This is a transcoder and nothing more: the values are upstream's, unedited, so
the blob can be checked against WDSP byte for byte. That includes a known
artefact in the low-xi corner — see the note in `nr2.rs`.

Both tables are indexed `[241 * n_xi + n_gamma]`, each axis running -30 dB to
+30 dB in 0.25 dB steps (WDSP's `getKey`: `10*log10(v/0.001)`, 4 steps per dB).

Blob layout, all little-endian:

    magic  "NR2T"          4 bytes
    grid   u32             points per axis (241)
    GG     grid^2 x f32    gain table, xi-major
    GGS    grid^2 x f32    speech-presence table, xi-major
