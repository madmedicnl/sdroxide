//! An [`IqSource`] for one DDC of an OpenHPSDR ethernet SDR, Protocol 1
//! (Metis / Hermes-Lite 2) or Protocol 2 — the protocol is detected at open
//! time. The DDC delivers wideband complex I/Q, so this drives the engine's
//! normal DDC/demod path exactly like a SoapySDR device (`audio_mode = false`);
//! transmit I/Q goes to the board's DUC (P2) or the EP2 frame stream (P1).
//!
//! The connection is shared: a Protocol 2 board carries several independently
//! tunable DDCs, so two radio tabs on the same address each take one over a
//! single connection. The [`crate::device_registry`] is what pairs a second
//! source with the first one's connection; the transmitter belongs to the
//! DDC-0 source alone, and Protocol 1 boards have only DDC 0.
