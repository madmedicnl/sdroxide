//! The AIS chart: every vessel being tracked, drawn the way a marine traffic
//! display draws one.
//!
//! The projection, the pan/zoom and the dotted continents are the FT8 panel
//! map's ([`crate::widgets::worldmap`]) — the views have to agree about where
//! the world is, and one of them owning that is how they do. What is here is
//! everything a sea picture needs and an air picture does not:
//!
//! - a **ship-shaped symbol**, drawn to the vessel's heading. This is the one
//!   place this map differs from [`crate::adsb_map`] on purpose rather than by
//!   accident: everything overhead is an aeroplane, so ADS-B draws a square and
//!   says nothing about the kind — but what is on the water is a tanker, a
//!   ferry, a fishing boat, a buoy, a lighthouse or a lifeboat, and which it is
//!   changes what a watchkeeper does next. So a ship is a hull outline pointed
//!   the way its bow is, a base station is a square with a mast, an aid to
//!   navigation is a diamond, a SAR aircraft is an aircraft, and a distress
//!   beacon is a cross that nothing else can be mistaken for.
//! - **history dots** behind it — where it has been, fading with age. The
//!   spacing of the dots is the speed, read before any number on the screen is.
//! - a **vector** ahead of it, as long as the distance covered in
//!   [`sdroxide_types::AisSettings::vector_minutes`]. Six minutes is the
//!   default a chart plotter uses, not the one minute a radar uses, because a
//!   ship's world moves at a tenth of an aircraft's.
//! - a **label** beside it: the name, and the speed. Two short lines, not the
//!   three a radar data block carries — a ship's altitude is zero and its name
//!   is what everybody calls it by.
//!
//! # Why the symbol points at the heading and the vector at the course
//!
//! They are different facts and a display that conflated them would be lying
//! about the one thing this picture is for. A vessel crabbing across a tideway
//! *points* twenty degrees off the track it is *making*, and both matter: the
//! heading is where the bow is and the course is where it will be. So the hull
//! is drawn to [`sdroxide_types::AisVessel::icon_deg`] and the vector to the
//! course over ground, and on a windy day they visibly disagree.
//!
//! # Why a stale target is not drawn at all
//!
//! Past [`sdroxide_types::AisSettings::drop_map_s`] a target's position is old
//! news and it comes off the chart — symbol, dots and label together. It stays
//! on the list, greyed. Fading it instead was the obvious alternative and is
//! wrong, for the reason the ADS-B map's note gives: a faint symbol at a stale
//! position is still a claim about where a ship is, drawn in the same ink as
//! the ones that are true.
//!
//! That window is five minutes here rather than ADS-B's ten *seconds*, and the
//! difference is not taste — a vessel at anchor reports once every three
//! minutes, so a shorter one would blank most of a harbour between two
//! perfectly good reports.
