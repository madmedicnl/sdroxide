//! Solar-system 3D view: Sun, Earth and Moon with their orbits, the operator's
//! QTH on the globe, live SDO solar imagery, and DONKI sunspot / CME data.
//!
//! The scene, camera, overlay and renderer are shared by both targets. What
//! differs is only how the view is hosted and where its data comes from:
//!
//! * **Native** — [`Solar3d`] emits a deferred egui viewport, which desktop
//!   eframe turns into a real second OS window, and owns a [`SolarFeed`] that
//!   fetches from NASA and NOAA directly.
//!   [`SolarFeed`]: sdroxide_solar::SolarFeed
//! * **Browser** — [`SolarApp`] is the whole app of a second tab, and its data
//!   arrives over the server's `/solar-ws` relay. There is no viewport to
//!   manage: the browser owns the tab.
//!
//! Both end in the same [`overlay::ui`] call against the same [`SolarUi`], so
//! there is one implementation of the view itself.
//!
//! Unlike the rest of this crate, this module is *not* written to WebGL2
//! downlevel limits: it uses a depth buffer, MSAA and vertex buffers. All of it
//! is confined to an offscreen pass, so the shared egui render pass — which on
//! the web must stay within those limits — is untouched.
