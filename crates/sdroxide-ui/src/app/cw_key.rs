//! A CW paddle read straight from the kernel's input layer (Linux, native).
//!
//! Some USB keyer boxes have no keyer in them: they report the two paddle
//! contacts and nothing else, often as the buttons of an otherwise useless
//! "mouse". This opens one interface's input devices, takes them exclusively
//! (`EVIOCGRAB`, so the contacts cannot also land as mouse clicks in whatever
//! window has focus), and publishes **the two contacts** for whoever is
//! transmitting.
//!
//! **It publishes contacts, not edges, and runs no keyer of its own** (issue
//! #569). A keyer on this side of the wire would make every element from
//! whatever this thread happened to sample — at 20 wpm a dit is 60 ms, inside
//! one 50 ms transmit block — and could not reach a rig that keys itself at
//! all, because on that route the sidetone is never transmitted. The iambic
//! timing belongs next to the transmitter, so the contacts go up the wire and
//! [`sdroxide_dsp::CwKeyer`] runs on the engine side. What is left here is the
//! device, and a monitor tone so the operator can hear their own paddle.
//!
//! A composite HID keyer often registers two nodes for the one physical
//! interface — a keyboard node and a mouse node — and which of them carries the
//! contacts depends on the firmware. Both are opened and grabbed, and the
//! dropdown lists one entry per interface rather than one per node.
//!
//! Native and Linux only: it is raw evdev, and the browser and the other
//! platforms have no equivalent. The keyer itself is portable and lives in the
//! DSP crate; this is only the part that touches a device.
