//! The session ignore list for the FT8/FT4/FT2 decode list.
//!
//! A **−** button on each decode mutes that station for the rest of the
//! session: their decodes stop arriving in the list, stop sounding the audible
//! alerts, stop being read out by the announcer, and stop being offered to auto
//! mode as a station to answer.
//!
//! **Session-only, on purpose.** It is a `HashSet` in the app with no file, no
//! wire type and no schema. A memory list is cheaper to run and cheaper to
//! build than a persisted one, and — the reason that matters — it cannot leave
//! a station permanently hidden because of something pressed by accident one
//! evening. Restarting sdroxide and hearing the band again is the reset.
//!
//! The filter reads as `session_ignored ∪ (future persisted)`, so a stored list
//! can be folded in later without touching a single call site: every consumer
//! asks [`is_ignored`] and nothing else knows how the set is built.
//!
//! Where the filter *runs* is the other decision, and it is made once, at the
//! `RadioEvent::Ft8Decodes` arm in `frame.rs`: as early as a decode enters the
//! app, so a muted station is genuinely out of the way rather than hidden from
//! one view and still ringing, still being auto-answered. The rows already on
//! screen are drawn dimmed rather than yanked — the row is how a mistaken press
//! is taken back, and no new ones arrive to replace them.
