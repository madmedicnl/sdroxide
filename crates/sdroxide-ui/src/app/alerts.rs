//! The [`AlertStatus`] mirrors the speech engine's status shape, and the
//! worker is the same shape as `sdroxide-speech`'s: a thread owns the cpal
//! output and its ring buffer, and jobs are paced into the ring rather than
//! blocking. The difference is that every job here is synthesised — a handful
//! of oscillator patterns — so there is no model to load and no first-sound
//! pause. The ring opens in flight (a few milliseconds of silence), which is
//! what makes the first alarm sound listenable.
