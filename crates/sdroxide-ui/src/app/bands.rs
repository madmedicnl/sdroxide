//! What each band is doing: the published forecast beside the measured field.
//!
//! Two answers to one question, and they are not the same answer.
//!
//! * **CONDX** is N0NBH's calculated verdict — one word per band group per half
//!   of the day, computed globally from the solar indices. It says nothing
//!   about this station, this antenna or any particular path, and it covers
//!   80 m through 10 m and nothing else. Three bands outside that span — 160 m,
//!   60 m and 11 m — read the nearest published group as a stand-in and are
//!   marked with "≈", hover for the explanation.
//! *   **WSPR** and **PSK** are the world's networks on the band over the last
//!     fifteen minutes: WSPR's weak-signal beacons from
//!     [wspr.live](https://wspr.live), the activity modes — FT8, FT4, the
//!     CW/RTTY reporting — from [PSK Reporter](https://pskreporter.info). A
//!     measurement that needs none of our own receivers to have heard anything,
//!     which is what makes it useful on a night when the operator's own antenna
//!     is deaf to the band.
//! * **PATHS**, **REACH** and **BEST** come from the propagation field: real
//!   receptions, by this station and — when the Reverse Beacon Network is
//!   switched on — by everyone else's. That is a measurement too, of this
//!   station's own sky rather than the world's.
//!
//! PATHS and REACH are both shown because either alone misleads: a contest
//! pile-up on one bearing is a great many paths through a very small piece of
//! sky, and a band that is quietly open everywhere is the reverse.
//!
//! Where they disagree the measurement is right, which is why they are shown
//! side by side rather than reconciled into one number.
//!
//! The empty cell is load-bearing throughout. A band with no verdict has none
//! published; a band with no paths was either shut or unattended, and this
//! window does not claim to know which.
