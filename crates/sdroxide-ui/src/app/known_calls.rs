//! The **KNOWN** window: who the digital decoder's hash table can currently
//! resolve.
//!
//! An FT8 message addresses a station by a one-way hash, so a `<...>` cannot be
//! turned back into a callsign by arithmetic — there is nothing inside it to
//! read. The only way to name a station is to have heard it spelled out, and
//! that set was previously invisible: the operator could see a message resolve
//! and had no way to see *why*, or to browse who they currently know.
//!
//! So this lists the set itself, newest first, and — because on 11 m that is the
//! question actually worth asking — **by country**. `19DC797` is a Dutch
//! station and `4CB04` an Argentine one, resolved through WSJT-CB's own
//! numbering ahead of the amateur table, and the flag machinery is the same one
//! the decode rows already draw.
