//! Receivers published on the public internet, and the directories that list
//! them.
//!
//! Two networks, chosen because between them they cover the band and because
//! sdroxide can drive both honestly:
//!
//! * **SpyServer** — Airspy's own server and the re-implementations that speak
//!   its protocol, listed at `airspy.com/directory/status.json`. Full I/Q, and
//!   [`crate::Backend::SpyServer`] already drives it, so the directory is the
//!   only thing that was missing. Mostly VHF/UHF dongles.
//! * **KiwiSDR** — the 0–30 MHz receivers (and the KiwiSDR 2 / Web-888 boards,
//!   which run the same firmware and speak the same protocol), listed by the
//!   `rx.kiwisdr.com` mirror at `rx.linkfanel.net`. A narrow I/Q window that
//!   follows the dial plus a full-band waterfall — the shape
//!   [`crate::Backend::SpyServerVfo`] and the Icom LAN scope already have.
//!
//! Deliberately *not* here: OpenWebRX, which delivers demodulated audio only
//! over a protocol that has diverged between its forks and has no
//! machine-readable directory; and PA3FWM's WebSDR, whose codec is proprietary
//! and whose author asks that third-party clients stay away.
//!
//! Parsing lives here rather than in `sdroxide-config` for the same reason
//! [`crate::broadcast::parse_schedule`] does: it is pure, it is wasm-safe, and
//! it can be tested against a checked-in sample with no network. The fetching
//! and caching are `sdroxide-config`'s.
