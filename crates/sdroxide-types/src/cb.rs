//! Licence-free channel plans: the citizens' band, per country, and PMR446.
//!
//! 11 m is not one band everywhere. The channel *set* is country law: the
//! CEPT/FCC 40 channels that most of the world shares, Germany's 80-channel
//! plan that adds a high band, and the UK's 27/81 channels, which sit at
//! different frequencies from anyone else's. An operator on 11 m thinks in
//! channel numbers, so the fork carries the plans and shows the channel.
//!
//! The same table also carries the **PMR446** service at 446 MHz — 16 narrow-FM
//! channels, or 32 dPMR446 FDMA ones — because it is the other licence-free
//! service a CB or SWL operator tunes by channel number, and it wants the same
//! treatment: a channel plan the dial reads in and a `CH nn` tag on the tuning
//! line, without claiming a band of its own (`CbPlan::is_uhf` tells the two
//! apart).
//!
//! ## What a plan does here
//!
//! Only the channels: which frequencies are channels, what the band opens
//! on, and (for the UI) the channel number the dial is on. The band's edges are
//! left wide — 26.965–27.860, covering every plan and the freeband between
//! them — so switching plans never moves the operator off the air or changes
//! what transmits. That is deliberate: a narrower plan is about labelling and
//! the default channel, not about locking the receiver.
//!
//! ## The 40-channel table is not a grid
//!
//! Channels 23–25 are the historical oddity (27.255, 27.235, 27.245), and the
//! spacing elsewhere is three 10 kHz steps then a 20 kHz skip. The table is
//! therefore written out rather than generated from a spacing.
