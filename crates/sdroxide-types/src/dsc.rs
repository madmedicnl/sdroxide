//! Digital Selective Calling — the marine distress and calling protocol.
//!
//! DSC is what fires every GMDSS distress alert: a short digital burst on
//! marine VHF channel 70 (156.525 MHz) and the MF/HF DSC channels
//! (2187.5, 4207.5, 6312, 8414.5, 12577, 16804.5 kHz). A distress alert
//! carries the sender's MMSI, the nature of the distress, a position and a
//! time; a routine call carries who is calling whom and the working channel
//! they are about to move to. It is the one marine emergency channel a
//! listener can decode, which is why it belongs in a listening program.
//!
//! # The wire, and the two layers
//!
//! ITU-R M.493-15 is the authority. The link layer is 1200-baud FFSK —
//! mark 1300 Hz, space 2100 Hz — carrying 10-bit characters, each of which
//! is 7 data bits plus a 3-bit BCH(10,7) check. **Every character is sent
//! twice**: once in the "DX" position and once in the "RX" position,
//! interleaved on a 20-bit grid. The check is a CRC-3, and because its
//! minimum distance is 2 it reliably *detects* a single-bit error but does
//! not reliably correct one; the DX/RX pair is where the redundancy that
//! actually recovers a character lives.
//!
//! What lives here is the **protocol layer**: the BCH codec, the MMSI and
//! position codecs, the format/category/nature tables, and the parser that
//! turns a run of post-BCH 7-bit symbols into a typed message. It is pure
//! arithmetic and tables — no I/O, no threads — so it compiles for the
//! browser and is unit-tested against the published field values.
//!
//! The bit-clock, the FFSK discriminator and the framer that recovers the
//! symbols from audio live in [`sdroxide_dsp::dsc`]. The split is the same
//! one NAVTEX uses: what a message *is* has no dependency on how it was
//! received.
//!
//! # Provenance
//!
//! The tables and codecs follow ITU-R M.493-15. Cross-checked against
//! [GopherTrunk](https://github.com/MattCheramie/GopherTrunk) (Apache-2.0),
//! which records them the same way.
