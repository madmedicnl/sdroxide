//! The station's external transmit/receive switch: relay boards, sequencers,
//! and the contact closures they all come down to.
//!
//! # What this is for
//!
//! An SDR sharing an antenna system with a transceiver has to be got out of the
//! way before the transceiver's RF appears, and put back afterwards. What hams
//! use for that is a relay — a coax relay that grounds the receiver's input, a
//! T/R switch, the antenna port on an amplifier — and every one of them is
//! driven the same way: a contact closes while transmitting and opens while
//! receiving.
//!
//! So this is not a driver for a board. It is a description of *when* a contact
//! should be closed, which the `sdroxide-relay` crate then produces on whatever
//! hardware is in the shack: a USB relay board, a serial handshake line, a
//! sound-card GPIO pin, a Raspberry Pi header, or a program the operator wrote.
//!
//! # Why the vocabulary lives here
//!
//! Same reason [`crate::LimeRfeConfig`] does: the settings panel is compiled to
//! wasm for the browser client, and a remote operator has to be able to set up
//! the switch on the machine the antenna is actually attached to. The hardware
//! half is native-only and lives in `sdroxide-relay`; nothing in this module
//! touches a port.
//!
//! # The sequencer
//!
//! Ordering falls out of the per-channel timings and needs no ordering field.
//! Every channel is asserted at `key-down − lead_ms`, so the longest lead goes
//! first: the antenna relay throws, then the amplifier is keyed. Every channel
//! is released at `key-up + hold_ms`, so the shortest hold drops first: the
//! amplifier unkeys, then the antenna comes back. That is what a sequencer
//! does, expressed as one number per channel per direction instead of a
//! priority list nobody can reason about.
//!
//! # The one thing software cannot do
//!
//! When a *separate* transceiver keys itself — its own microphone button, foot
//! switch, VOX or keyer — sdroxide does not know until it next asks over CAT,
//! which is typically 300–600 ms into the over. The relay throws then, and not
//! before. See [`SenseConfig`] for the wire that fixes it, and the manual for
//! why a genuinely valuable front end wants an RF-sensed hardware switch
//! regardless.
