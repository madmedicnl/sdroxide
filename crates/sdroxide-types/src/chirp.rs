//! Reading and writing channel lists in CHIRP's CSV format.
//!
//! CHIRP is the program most people use to programme a handheld, and its CSV
//! export is what repeater directories hand out: RepeaterBook offers it by
//! county, national societies publish their machine lists in it, and the marine
//! and PMR channel tables circulate as it too. That makes it the one format
//! worth reading here — an operator who wants their local repeaters in
//! sdroxide already has the file (issue #234).
//!
//! ⚠️ Transcribed from CHIRP's own `chirp/chirp_common.py` (the `Memory` fields
//! and the `TONE_MODES` / `DUPLEX_MODES` tables) and from files it exports, not
//! from a specification — CHIRP has none. The columns are matched **by header
//! name**, so a file with the columns in another order, or with only some of
//! them, still reads; a file with no header row at all is refused rather than
//! guessed at, because the first line of a headerless list is a real channel
//! and mistaking it for a header would silently drop it.
//!
//! What is deliberately not carried: `Skip` (sdroxide's scanner has its own
//! idea of what to skip), `Power` (a channel does not set the transmitter's
//! power here), `TStep`, and the D-STAR columns. A memory here is a frequency,
//! a mode, the repeater set-up and a name.
