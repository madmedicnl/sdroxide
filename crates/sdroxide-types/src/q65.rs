//! Q65 vocabulary shared by the engine, the wire protocol and the panel.
//!
//! **Interface facts only.** Q65's sync pattern, QRA LDPC tables and sub-mode
//! geometry live in `sdroxide-digi`, which already carries the GPL obligation
//! for mfsk-core. What is here is what the UI and the wire need to talk about
//! Q65 at all: which sub-mode is selected, how long its slot is, how the
//! sub-modes are named. Nothing here is derived from WSJT-X source, so this
//! crate stays permissive-intent and wasm-clean.
//!
//! # The two axes
//!
//! Q65 sub-modes vary along two independent axes, and the WSJT-X name is
//! `<period><letter>` — Q65-60A, Q65-120E and so on:
//!
//! * **T/R period** — 15, 30, 60, 120 or 300 seconds. Longer is deeper and
//!   slower, exactly as FST4's periods are.
//! * **Tone-spacing letter** A–E — spacing = baud × 2^(letter−1), so a higher
//!   letter is wider and tolerates more Doppler spread. **A** is the narrow,
//!   sensitive terrestrial choice; **E** is for the fast-fading paths (microwave
//!   EME, ionoscatter) where a wide signal is the only one that survives.
//!
//! mfsk-core wires ten of the combinations; the ones absent here (e.g.
//! Q65-30B) are not in the crate.
