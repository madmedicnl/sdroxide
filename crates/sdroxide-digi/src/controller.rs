//! `DigiController` — the real-time-loop glue that ties the modem, QSO
//! machine, and slot scheduler into the engine.
//!
//! The engine calls [`on_rx_audio`](DigiController::on_rx_audio) with the
//! demodulated audio tap each block, and [`poll`](DigiController::poll) once
//! per loop tick. `poll` never blocks: heavy LDPC decode runs on a worker
