//! FSK441 — the original high-speed meteor-scatter mode, receive side.
//!
//! Four-tone FSK at 441 baud on 882 / 1323 / 1764 / 2205 Hz, carrying the
//! 43-character PUA-43 alphabet three dits to a character. A meteor leaves a
//! short ionised trail, so the receiver hears pings of ten to a few hundred
//! milliseconds at random points through a 30-second (or 15-second) T/R period;
//! the operator transmits the message over and over and the decoder's job is to
//! catch whatever fragment a trail reflects and read the text out of it.
//!
//! # Why this is not mfsk-core
//!
//! Every other weak-signal mode in `sdroxide-digi` is a feature flag over
//! mfsk-core's WSJT-X port. FSK441 is not in mfsk-core, so this is the fork's
//! own decoder — the 4-FSK front end, the ping search and the alphabet. It
//! follows the published definition (K1JT, *Definition and specification of the
//! FSK441 encoding scheme used in WSJT*, 2001) and the MIT-licensed Rust
//! reference [`Nythbran23/FSK441-PLUS`](https://github.com/Nythbran23/FSK441-PLUS)
//! (© 2026 Roger Banks GW4WND), whose constants and search shape this port
//! keeps: 25 samples a dit at 11 025 Hz, the sliding matched-filter detector,
//! the sample-level sync search, and the "tone 3 never starts a character"
//! framing that recovers the character boundary.
//!
//! # The rate
//!
//! 441 baud is exactly 25 samples at 11 025 Hz — the rate WSJT and MSHV both
//! capture at. The engine's clean tap is 48 kHz, so the controller resamples to
//! [`FSK441_RATE`] before this sees a sample, exactly as the other modes
//! resample to 12 kHz. Do not re-derive the constants at another rate: the
//! NSPD window and the tone spacing are the mode.
