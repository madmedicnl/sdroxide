//! A rolling window of the last couple of minutes of audio, for instant replay.
//!
//! A shortwave listener misses things — a station identification, a frequency
//! the announcer reads out, the start of a programme while tuning past it — and
//! wants to hear *that* again. This keeps the recent past so they can.
//!
//! The model is a delay line rather than a recorder: the read pointer trails
//! the write pointer by the whole window, so while replay is on the listener
//! hears the last hours-worth going forward, two minutes behind live. Stop, and
//! it snaps back to now. That is exactly a DVR, and it is the least surprising
//! thing to build out of one buffer.
//!
//! Mono on purpose: the ring is fed the speaker's summed channel. A stereo
//! replay would need both channels kept in step, and the left sum is what a
//! listener replays a faded broadcast for anyway.
