//! The SmartSDR wire format: the ASCII command/status protocol on TCP 4992 and
//! the VITA-49 data packets on UDP.
//!
//! Both halves of this crate share it — the client parses what a radio sends and
//! builds what a client sends; the simulator does exactly the reverse — so every
//! codec here is written as a matched pair and tested by round-tripping.
//!
//! # Control protocol
//!
//! Every line is ASCII, `\n`-terminated, and identified by its first character:
//!
//! | Tag | Direction | Shape | Meaning |
//! |-----|-----------|-------|---------|
//! | `V` | radio → client | `V1.4.0.0` | firmware/protocol version, sent first |
//! | `H` | radio → client | `H1A2B3C4D` | this client's handle, in hex |
//! | `C` | client → radio | `C<seq>\|<command>` | a sequenced command |
//! | `R` | radio → client | `R<seq>\|<hex code>\|<body>` | reply to command `seq` |
//! | `S` | radio → client | `S<handle>\|<object> <k>=<v> …` | status update |
//! | `M` | radio → client | `M<hex id>\|<text>` | log/notice message |
//!
//! A result code of `0` is success. Codes are *hexadecimal* and unsigned: fatal
//! ones such as `F3000001` have the high bit set, so parsing them as a signed
//! decimal integer silently turns a hard rejection into an apparent success.
//!
//! # VITA-49
//!
//! Data rides UDP as VITA-49 packets with a fixed 28-byte (7-word) header, all
//! big-endian. Word 3's low 16 bits hold the *packet class code*, which is what
//! actually says whether the payload is IQ, audio, FFT bins or meter readings —
//! the stream ID in word 1 only says which of our streams it belongs to.
//!
//! One payload does **not** follow the header's big-endian rule: `dax_iq`
//! carries little-endian float32 (the radio reports `payload_endian=little` for
//! that stream type alone). Reading it big-endian byte-reverses every float into
//! a denormal ≈ 0, which reads as a dead-silent receiver rather than as an
//! error — so it is called out at [`decode_dax_iq`].
