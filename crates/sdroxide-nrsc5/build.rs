//! Builds the vendored nrsc5 HD Radio library and the single-precision FFTW
//! stand-in it needs, both straight with `cc` rather than nrsc5's CMake.
//!
//! The `HAVE_*` CFLAGS below select what upstream's `configure_file` would
//! have guessed. What matters is the shape of the build:
//!
//! * **nrsc5** — `vendor/nrsc5` is a GPL-3.0-or-later submodule (see the
//!   package manifest for where that sits licence-wise). The CLI (`main.c`) is
//!   not built; the library itself and `rtltcp.c` are. Its own CMake only
//!   exists to wire up fftw3f and faad2, neither of which is usable here.
//!   `src/rtlsdr_stubs.c` supplies no-ops, under private names, for the
//!   librtlsdr calls the library makes on its device path, which the pipe path
//!   never reaches.
//! * **fftw3f** — `include/fftw3.h` plus `src/fftwf_compat.c` provide the five
//!   single-precision entry points the library uses. Every transform the
//!   receive path creates is a power of two (2048 in FM, 256 in AM), so the
//!   stand-in is a plain radix-2 Cooley-Tukey and needs none of Dream's
//!   Bluestein fallback.
//! * **faad2** — nrsc5 decodes its HDC audio with `NeAACDec*`, from the one
//!   DRM+HDC faad2 archive `crates/sdroxide-faad2` builds with nrsc5's HDC
//!   patch applied. The include path is that crate's patched headers
//!   (`DEP_FAAD2_INCLUDE`), so `NeAACDecInitHDC` is declared; the unpatched
//!   `vendor/faad2` does not have it. A second faad2 copy must never be
//!   compiled in.
//!
//! Opened on a pipe, the library runs no thread of its own: all of its work and
//! every callback happen inside the call that pipes samples in, which is why
//! `src/worker.rs` makes that call from a thread of its own. The Windows CI
//! build is MinGW, like nrsc5's own `msys2-build`; MSVC cannot compile this C
//! at all.
