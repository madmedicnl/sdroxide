//! Decode a recorded FM channel through `HdDemod`, off a capture made by
//! `sdroxide --record-iq` at 4x the FM rate (2,976,750 S/s).
//!
//!     cargo run --release -p sdroxide-nrsc5 --example hd_capture -- \
//!         cap.cf32 <capture centre Hz> <channel Hz> [capture rate] [programme]
//!
//! The capture rate defaults to 2,976,750 S/s — four times the decoder's own
//! rate, which is what an `sdroxide --record-iq` file of an FM band usually is.
//! Pass 744187.5 for a clip already cut to one channel at the decoder's rate,
//! and the shift and decimation fall away. Any other rate works: the
//! decimation stays whole and the decoder is told the rate that produces, so
//! its own resampler closes the remaining fraction.
//!
//! The capture centre is the *front end's* centre, which is not the dial
//! frequency when the device tunes with an LO offset — `--record-iq` writes
//! what the device produced. sdroxide's "source ready" line reports the offset
//! in force; an RSPdx at 2 Msps offsets by a quarter of the rate, so a station
//! on a 99.5 MHz dial sits in a capture centred on 100.0 MHz.
//!
//! Prints what the decoder reports so a real station can be checked without a
//! GUI: lock, per-sideband MER, CBER, the station's identity, the stereo side
//! channel's level, how much audio came out, and the backlog drop count (which
//! must be zero — a climbing one is a queue drained slower than the decoder
//! fills it).
//!
//! The decoder runs on a thread of its own and `process` never waits for it,
//! so this reads the file only as fast as that thread takes the samples: fed
//! at disk speed, the queue into it would overflow and a healthy capture would
//! look like a failing decoder.
