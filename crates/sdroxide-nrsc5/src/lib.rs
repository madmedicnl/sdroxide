//! HD Radio (NRSC-5) decoding, wrapping the vendored `nrsc5` library.
//!
//! The crate is the decoder for the HD Radio band: it takes raw I/Q samples
//! (via `HdReceiver::pipe_*`, at nrsc5's native sample rate — see the
//! `NRSC5_SAMPLE_RATE_*` definitions upstream) and turns them into decoded
//! audio and the SIS/ID3 metadata broadcasters send.
//!
//! [`HdReceiver`] is a thin binding on purpose. Opened on a pipe, the C library
//! runs no thread of its own: each `pipe_*` call does the decoding and fires
//! the callbacks before it returns, and they reach this side as `Event`s
//! through a plain channel. `HdReceiver` is therefore `Send` (move it to the
//! thread that will feed it) but not `Sync`: the pipe functions and the close
//! must not run concurrently. [`HdDemod`] is the receive-chain demodulator
//! built on it, and keeps that work off the chain's thread.
//!
//! Audio reaches the caller as `Event::Audio` in signed 16-bit interleaved
//! stereo PCM at 44.1 kHz, exactly as nrsc5 emits it. Metadata arrives as the
//! station / SIS
//! events; the finer data services (LOT files, HERE images, ID3 tags, the SIG
//! table) are decoded inside the library but not yet surfaced here.
//!
//! # Linking faad2
//!
//! nrsc5 decodes its HDC audio with faad2's `NeAACDec*` symbols. They come
//! from `sdroxide-faad2`, the one faad2 archive in the binary — upstream faad2
//! with nrsc5's HDC patch applied at build time, shared with the DRM receiver.
//! Two faad2 copies in the same binary must never happen: they collide on
//! every `NeAACDec*` symbol.
