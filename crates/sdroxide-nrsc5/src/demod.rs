//! [`HdDemod`] — HD Radio as a demodulator: channel-rate complex baseband in,
//! decoded programme audio out.
//!
//! It sits where `DrmDemod` or `WfmDemod` would, because that is what it is —
//! RF in, sound out, no keyboard, no transmit, no QSO. The differences from an
//! analog demod are the same ones DRM has, and for the same reasons:
//!
//! * the audio for a block is not made from that block's samples. HD Radio's
//!   audio is a block-interleaved HDC stream behind an OFDM frame, so what
//!   comes back now was transmitted a fraction of a second ago;
//! * the decoder produces audio at its own rate (44.1 kHz), not ours, so the
//!   two are rate-matched here rather than assumed equal;
//! * the decoder is a vendored C library, and on a pipe it does all of its work
//!   inside the call that hands it samples. So it runs on a thread of its own
//!   (see `src/worker.rs`): this side queues channel I/Q for it and plays
//!   back what it has decoded, and nothing heavier than a copy happens on the
//!   receive chain's thread.
//!
//! FM only for now. The AM-band variant (HD on AM) needs the decoder opened in
//! its AM mode and fed at 46,511.71875 S/s instead, which the engine would have
//! to choose from the dial frequency; until then this demod serves the FM band,
//! where nearly all HD Radio listening is.
