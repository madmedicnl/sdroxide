//! The HD Radio decoder on its own thread.
//!
//! nrsc5 opened on a pipe starts no thread of its own: `nrsc5_pipe_samples_cf32`
//! runs acquisition, the OFDM demodulator, Viterbi, Reed-Solomon and the HDC
//! audio decoder inside the call, and fires every callback before returning.
//! Fed from [`crate::HdDemod::process`] that is all of it on the receive chain's
//! thread, at three quarters of a million samples a second — along with the
//! resampling to get there — and every lane that thread serves would wait on it.
//! So the chain only queues its channel I/Q, and this thread does the rest: the
//! same arrangement `sdroxide-drm` has, and for the same reason.
//!
//! The two sides meet in [`Shared`]: channel I/Q goes in over a lock-free ring,
//! and decoded audio and the status snapshot come back under short locks.
