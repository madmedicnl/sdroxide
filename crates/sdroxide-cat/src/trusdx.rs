//! (tr)uSDX CAT — DL2MAN/PE1NNZ's pocket QRP transceiver and the open uSDX
//! firmware it grew from. A fourth Kenwood dialect, with the audio *inside* the
//! control link.
//!
//! The radio emulates a Kenwood TS-480 and answers `ID;` with `020`, so on
//! paper a Kenwood profile would drive it. On the wire the subset is thin
//! enough that it would also spend most of its frames being refused: the
//! firmware answers `?;` to `SM`, `RM`, `SL`, `SH`, `PC`, `AG` (the bare read),
//! `FB`, `FR`, `FT`, `RA`, `SQ` and the rest, because it has no S-meter, no
//! SWR, no power control, no VFO B, no split and no keyer. What it *does*
//! answer is:
//!
//! | Command | Meaning |
//! |---------|---------|
//! | `FA;` / `FAnnnnnnnnnnn;` | read / set the dial |
//! | `MD;` / `MDn;` | read / set the mode, 1..5 = LSB USB CW FM AM |
//! | `IF;` | status: the dial, and the transmit flag |
//! | `ID;` | `ID020;` |
//! | `PS;` | power on/off state |
//! | `TX;` `TX0;` `TX1;` `TX2;` | key, unkey, key, tune |
//! | `RX;` | unkey |
//! | `AG0;` `FL0;` `RS;` `AI;` `VX;` `RC;` `RT1;` `XT1;` | the handful of |
//! |   | settings the firmware kept |
//!
//! Every one of those was confirmed against a bench radio rather than read off
//! the manual — see the module's own history. The manual's own list is a
//! *superset*: it names commands the firmware's parser does not reach.
//!
//! # The audio is on the same wire
//!
//! This is what makes it a family and not a Kenwood with a note attached. A
//! (tr)uSDX has **no sound card at all**. Receive audio and transmit audio are
//! 8-bit streams carried inside the CAT serial link, switched on with the
//! firmware's own `UA` extension:
//!
//! * `UA1;` turns streaming on with the speaker, `UA2;` with the speaker off,
//!   `UA0;` off. The reply is `UA1;` immediately followed by `US`.
//! * `US` is **not** terminated. Receive audio runs until a CAT command
//!   arrives, at which point the firmware writes a `;`, the reply, and then
//!   `US` again to resume. The host therefore sees
//!   `[audio] ; FA00014031000; US [audio]`, and has to tell the three apart.
//! * The receive rate is ~7812 samples/s (the firmware divides a timer; the
//!   measured figure on the bench was 7812.3, and the published ones — 7812,
//!   7820, 7825 — disagree). Transmit is 11520 samples/s, and the *host*
//!   paces it: the radio does not clock the bytes back.
//! * The firmware escapes a `0x3B` sample byte to `0x3C` on receive, because a
//!   bare `;` would end the stream. The host must do the same on transmit.
//!
//! # Two things about the hardware that the driver has to work around
//!
//! * **Opening the port may reset the radio.** On the common CH340 board the
//!   serial adapter's DTR is wired to the ATmega's reset, and the radio comes
//!   up announcing itself with an unsolicited `IF…;` a moment later. Toggling
//!   DTR resets it again. So DTR is held high for the whole session and never
//!   offered as a keying line — a PTT on DTR would reboot the radio on every
//!   over.
//! * **A CAT command written while the stream is running kills it.** Not
//!   pauses it — kills it. Measured on the bench: a single `FA;` mid-stream
//!   took the rate from ~6 kB/s to zero, and re-sending `UA1;` over the dead
//!   stream made it worse. The stream only comes back when it is stopped
//!   (`UA0;`) and started again. So this profile polls nothing at all
//!   ([`TrUsdx::poll_requests`] is empty), and every control frame is
//!   bracketed `UA0;` … `UA1;` by the serial thread. The radio's own dial and
//!   mode are therefore not followed, and each command costs a brief gap.
//!
//! Written against a bench radio running DL2MAN firmware 2.x, and against the
//! open uSDX firmware (`threeme3/usdx`) for the framing the two share. The
//! transmit-audio path is DL2MAN's and is not in the open firmware, so the
//! transmit rate and the escape are taken from the firmware's own documentation
//! and confirmed only as far as a dummy load allows.
//!
//! # nG, the second generation
//!
//! The same profile also drives DL2MAN's rewritten **nG** firmware
//! ([`TrUsdx::new_ng`], chosen by [`sdroxide_types::CatFamily::TrUsdxNg`]). The
//! receive side and the `UA`/`US` framing are unchanged — 7812.5 B/s, the same
//! receive escape — so the demultiplexer below is the same code. Three things
//! on the transmit side differ, and each is a silent failure if got wrong:
//!
//! * the rate is **4807.69 B/s** (the transmit slot is `20 MHz / (64 × 65)`),
//!   not 2.00x's 11520 — see [`sdroxide_types::TRUSDX_NG_TX_RATE_HZ`];
//! * the delimiter escape is **`0x3B → 0x3A`**, where 2.00x shifts up to
//!   `0x3C` — see [`sdroxide_types::TRUSDX_NG_TX_ESCAPE_TO`];
//! * the stream opens on the first byte **≥ `0x80`**, so a leading `0x80`
//!   (silence) is emitted when the first real sample is low — see
//!   [`sdroxide_types::TRUSDX_NG_TX_START_BYTE`].
//!
//! nG also adds a level extension the profile uses: `AG0nn;` (volume 00–31)
//! and `GTn;` (gain control 0 off / 1 on / 2 DIGI), neither answered nor
//! stored, so they are re-asserted whenever the link opens; and it accepts
//! `UA2;` to switch the radio's own speaker off while it streams.
//!
//! The nG figures come from DL2MAN's own notes for app developers and are
//! **not** confirmed against an nG radio here — the firmware was not available
//! on this bench. They are unit-tested structurally, and the on-air checks are
//! named in the fork's notes.
