//! The channel plan, and which of it a given receiver window can reach.
//!
//! # Why fixed channels rather than a wideband burst detector
//!
//! Every VDL2 transmission in the world is on one of fourteen frequencies.
//! Watching
//! the whole 300 kHz for a burst and then going back for the samples means
//! keeping a wideband history long enough to re-extract from, and the answer it
//! produces is a channel that was in this table all along. Parking a
//! downconverter on each channel costs one [`sdroxide_dsp::Ddc`] apiece and
//! nothing else, and it cannot miss the start of a transmission because it was
//! already listening — which for a burst whose first sixteen symbols are the
//! only synchronisation there is, is the whole game.
//!
//! # One window, fourteen channels
//!
//! The plan spans 350 kHz including the outer channels' own bandwidth, so a
//! single half-megahertz window covers the lot on any receiver in this tree —
//! an RTL-SDR at 2.4 Msps lands on a 480 kHz window and clears the outermost
//! channel by 5 kHz. A narrower one reaches fewer, and which ones it reaches
//! depends on where the hardware centre happens to be — so the window slides
//! inside the front end's span to take in as much of the plan as it can, and the
//! panel is told what it got.
//!
//! # Neighbours, and what keeps them out
//!
//! The channels are the 25 kHz raster itself, not every other slot of it, so two
//! that are both in use can be adjacent — 136.900 and 136.925 are, and one of
//! them is somebody's local airport. Nothing in front of the demodulator
//! separates them: each channel's downconverter is designed against its own
//! output rate, which is ten times a channel wide. Two things do the separating.
//! [`crate::demod::ChannelFilter`] keeps a neighbour out of the *decision*, and
//! [`crate::gate::Gate`]'s own detection filter keeps it from opening the gate
//! in the first place — without which a strong station 25 kHz away is counted as
//! a burst on a channel it was never on.
//!
//! Source: the European ICAO Frequency Management Manual (EUR Doc 011) for
