//! The signal levels a real receiver actually delivers.
//!
//! This exists because of a bug that made the whole lane useless on air while
//! every other test passed: rtl_433's default minimum detection level is about
//! -12 dBFS, which suits an RTL-SDR setting its own gain and does not suit a
//! decimated window from a receiver that has none. On an RX-888 at 868 MHz a
//! sensor burst is 35 to 65 dB below full scale — under that threshold, so the
//! pulse detector never opened and nothing decoded at all.
//!
//! The synthetic transmissions elsewhere in this crate were written at a
//! comfortable level and so never saw it. These are deliberately weak.
