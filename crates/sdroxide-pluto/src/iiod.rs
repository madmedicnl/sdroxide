//! The IIOD wire protocol, on one TCP connection.
//!
//! `iiod` — the daemon a Pluto runs on port 30431 — speaks a line-oriented text
//! protocol. Commands are `\r\n`-terminated ASCII; **every** reply begins with a
//! decimal integer on its own line, which is a byte count when it is positive
//! and `-errno` when it is negative. Commands that return data follow that line
//! with exactly that many bytes.
//!
//! ```text
//! VERSION                                    -> "<maj>.<min> <git-tag>"
//! PRINT                                      -> len, len bytes of XML, "\n"
//! TIMEOUT <ms>                               -> code
//! READ  <dev> [INPUT|OUTPUT <chan>] <attr>   -> len, len bytes, "\n"
//! WRITE <dev> [INPUT|OUTPUT <chan>] <attr> <len> + bytes  -> code
//! OPEN  <dev> <samples> <mask> [CYCLIC]      -> code
//! CLOSE <dev>                                -> code
//! READBUF  <dev> <bytes>   -> { len, mask, len bytes } … until len <= 0
//! WRITEBUF <dev> <bytes>   -> code, send bytes, -> code
//! EXIT
//! ```
//!
//! # The two framing details that matter
//!
//! **`READBUF` is chunked.** A request larger than the server's own buffer comes
//! back as several `{length, mask, data}` groups, and the sequence ends on a
//! length of zero or an error. Each positive-length group is preceded by the
//! channel mask, printed as `words × 8` hex characters — the same shape `OPEN`
//! takes it in. [`Connection::read_buf`] therefore reads the mask on every
//! group, not just the first.
//!
//! **A gap in the data is not a broken connection.** See [`Patient`]: the
//! receive timeout that keeps a dead link from wedging a thread also fires on an
//! ordinary stall, and letting it through would leave a half-read message with
//! no way to say how much had already been consumed.
//!
//! **`WRITE`'s length counts the bytes that follow**, and libiio appends a
//! trailing NUL to attribute strings. Writing `"40"` is three bytes, not two;
//! a length that disagrees with what follows desynchronises the connection for
//! the rest of the session, which surfaces much later as a nonsense reply to an
//! unrelated command.
//!
//! # Provenance
//!
//! The command set and framing are transcribed from libiio's `iiod-client.c`
//! (the client half) and `iiod/ops.c` (the server half), LGPL-2.1-or-later.
//! **Not verified against hardware** — see [`crate::trace`] for how a tester
//! reports what the wire actually looked like.

/// - **The board has paused** (issue #288): its own processor too busy to
///   feed the network for a second or two. Every connection goes quiet with
///   it, the bytes arrive when it recovers, and redialling costs a socket and
///   a buffer reopen for a transfer that was going to finish.
/// - **This one socket is stuck** (issues #377, #418): the daemon answers a
///   fresh connection in milliseconds while this one delivers nothing, for as
///   long as anyone cares to wait — the stalls in the #377 and #447 logs ran
///   out the longest deadline they were given, six seconds, time after time,
///   and every redial after one worked at once. Waiting on that is dead
///   audio, seconds per stall.
///
/// So on a connection with a probe address, a silence that outlasts
