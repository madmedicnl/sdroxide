//! The station's external transmit/receive switch, as the engines see it.
//!
//! One shared [`TrSwitch`] is handed to every engine in the process, the way
//! [`crate::TxGate`] is, and for a related reason: the relay that grounds the
//! SDR's antenna belongs to the *station*, not to any one radio. Several
//! engines may be running, any of them may key, and the contacts must follow
//! all of them — so each engine publishes whether it is on the air and the
//! switch follows the OR. The last radio to unkey is what releases it; a radio
//! that never keyed cannot.
//!
//! The hardware itself lives behind `sdroxide_relay::RelayHandle`, which is a
//! thread and a port. This type is the arbitration in front of it, and it is
//! deliberately almost nothing: two atomics on the hot path, because
//! [`TrSwitch::publish`] is called on every engine tick and [`TrSwitch::key`]
//! sits in the key-down path at its most time-critical moment.
//!
//! # What the engine owes it
//!
//! * [`TrSwitch::key`] **before** RF, and the caller must wait the returned
//!   lead. That is the one guarantee the whole subsystem exists to make.
//! * [`TrSwitch::unkey`] after RF stops — the hold times are the driver's
//!   business, so this returns at once.
//! * [`TrSwitch::abort`] when a key-down was refused *after* the contacts were
//!   thrown. No RF appeared, so there is nothing to protect on the way out and
//!   the hold would only delay the receiver coming back.
//! * [`TrSwitch::publish`] every tick, for the overs sdroxide does not drive:
//!   a transceiver keyed at its own microphone, or a rig sending CW from its
//!   own keyer.
//! * [`TrSwitch::set_tx_band`] whenever its transmit dial changes band, and
//!   the primary engine [`TrSwitch::set_rx_band`] whenever its receive dial
//!   does, for a station whose relay bank also switches external filters or
//!   a transverter by band (`sdroxide_types::RelayRole::BandDecoder`, issue
//!   #442). Bands, not output words: the worker resolves them against its
//!   own configuration and decides RX word or TX word from the station's
//!   on-air ramp, so a band-decoder contact moves inside its lead like every
//!   other one. The TX band that counts is the keying radio's — [`TrSwitch::key`]
//!   sends it ahead of the key-down itself.
