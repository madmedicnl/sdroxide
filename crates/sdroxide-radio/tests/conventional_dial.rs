//! Choosing a digital mode that has a published calling frequency moves the
//! dial onto it — and must not when the operator is already listening there.
//!
//! The rule has been here for the slotted modes and WSPR for a long time. SSTV
//! was missing from it, which is not a gap anyone noticed until an operator
//! reported the obvious thing: pick a band, pick SSTV, and be somewhere
//! useless, with the only way out being the **FREQ** chip in the SSTV panel.
//! SSTV is a one-frequency-per-band mode by the same argument as every other
//! mode this covers, and its table (`SSTV_DIALS`) is region-tagged and
//! published, so it belongs in the same place.
//!
//! What makes this safe enough to do without being asked is the check *inside*
//! `conventional_dial_for`: a dial already sitting on one of the mode's own
//! frequencies is never moved. So the only case this rescues is a dial that is
//! nowhere the mode would put anyone.
