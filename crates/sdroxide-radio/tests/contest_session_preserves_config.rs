//! Starting a contest session must not rewrite the digital configuration.
//!
//! The contest logger opens from its own panel, not the digi panel, and the
//! only thing it needs to tell the engine is which FT8 contest layout to send.
//! It was saying that by pushing a whole `DigiConfig` — its own copy, with one
//! field changed — through `Command::SetDigiConfig`.
//!
//! That makes the panel's copy authoritative over the engine's, and the
//! consequence is not confined to the contest. `DigiConfig` rides whole and
//! positionally, so any field the panel's copy is stale on is rolled back to
//! whatever the panel happened to be holding. Two failures follow:
//!
//! 1. **An FT8 contest layout the operator had already set is cleared.** Every
//!    contest except EU VHF has no FT8 layout, so the logger maps all of them
//!    to `ContestMode::None`. Opening a session therefore wrote `None` over a
//!    layout that was working, silently turning the feature off — and the
//!    symptom appears in the digi panel, far from the button that caused it.
//! 2. **Every field a build adds to `DigiConfig` is exposed to the same
//!    clobber.** A panel that predates a field, or was simply not re-synced
//!    after it was added elsewhere, writes that field's default over the
//!    operator's setting. The fix is structural: a setting that needs writing
//!    one field gets a command that carries one field, so the blast radius of
//!    the write is the field.
//!
//! So these tests are about what survives, not about the command's own effect.
//! The contest mode changing is covered elsewhere; what could have been lost is
//! what is at stake.
