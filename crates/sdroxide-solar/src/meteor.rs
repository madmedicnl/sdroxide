//! Annual meteor showers: which are active, how strong, and where the radiant
//! is for the observer right now.
//!
//! A shower is a fixed date window and a fixed radiant, so the whole module is
//! a static table and two bits of arithmetic — no network, no state, no I/O.
//! That is deliberate: it is the one propagation forecast that does not depend
//! on the ionosphere, and it is the same every year, so it is worth carrying
//! rather than fetching.
//!
//! The shower dates, radiants, rates and velocities are the International
//! Meteor Organization's working list, at the peak. The radiant drifts a little
//! through a shower's window (the IMO publishes a degree or so a day); that
//! drift is well inside the "is the radiant up" question this answers, and the
//! table carries the peak position rather than pretending to more precision.
//!
//! Why a listener cares: a meteor leaves an ionised trail, and a trail that
//! crosses a path briefly opens it — meteor scatter is worked on 6 m and 2 m
//! (and heard as the "pings" on the low VHF broadcast band), and the long
//! over-the-horizon paths on 10 m and 11 m can come alive for seconds at a
//! time. The useful question is not "how many meteors" but "is the radiant
//! above the horizon, and is the shower near its peak".
