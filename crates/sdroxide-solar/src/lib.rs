//! Solar-system ephemeris and space-weather data for the sdroxide 3D view.
//!
//! Two halves, and the split is along the target boundary:
//!
//! * **Portable** — [`ephem`] and [`planets`] (pure arithmetic, unit-tested
//!   against the worked examples in Meeus and against JPL Horizons), the
//!   parsers for every product, [`satellites`] SGP4 propagation, and [`data`],
//!   the snapshot type they all fill. No I/O, no threads: this half compiles
//!   for `wasm32-unknown-unknown`.
//! * **Native only** — [`feed`] and [`cache`]: one background thread fetching
//!   DONKI coronal mass ejections and flares, NOAA SWPC sunspot regions and
//!   aurora, and SDO solar imagery over blocking HTTPS, cached to disk so the
//!   view opens instantly and survives being offline. Both are `cfg`-gated out
//!   of the browser build, which is fed by the server's relay instead.
