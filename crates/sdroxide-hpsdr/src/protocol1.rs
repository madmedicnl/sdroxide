//! OpenHPSDR Protocol 1 ("old protocol" / Metis / Ozy) — enough for RX + SSB TX,
//! which covers Hermes-Lite 2 and legacy Metis/Hermes boards.
//!
//! Everything runs over UDP port 1024. Data datagrams are 1032 bytes:
//! `0xEF 0xFE 0x01 <endpoint>` + a 4-byte big-endian sequence, then two 512-byte
//! "OZY" frames. Each frame is `0x7F 0x7F 0x7F` + five command-and-control bytes
//! (C0..C4) + 504 bytes of data (63 samples × 8 bytes for one receiver).
//!
//! - RX (endpoint 6, radio→host): each sample is I (24-bit signed big-endian) +
//!   Q (24-bit) + mic (16-bit) = 8 bytes. EP6 arrives at the DDC rate.
//! - TX (endpoint 2, host→radio): each sample is L + R audio (16-bit) + TX I +
//!   TX Q (16-bit signed) = 8 bytes. We send zero audio and the modulator's I/Q.
//!   EP2 is a **fixed 48 kHz** stream in both directions of the protocol —
//!   the radio drains it at 48 ksps whatever the DDC rate is, so it must be
//!   paced by the clock, not by how fast EP6 comes back.
//!
//! The C0..C4 registers are round-robined on outgoing frames. C0 bit 0 is MOX
//! (PTT); C0 bits 7..1 are the register address. Frequencies are the actual
//! value in **Hz** (32-bit big-endian in C1..C4), not a phase word.
//!
//! Incoming EP6 frames carry C&C the other way: C0 bits 2..0 are the hardware
//! PTT/dash/dot lines and bits 7..3 select which sensor set C1..C4 hold.
//!
//! Offsets follow the g0orx/rustyHPSDR reference and the OpenHPSDR/Hermes-Lite 2
//! protocol docs; verify against hardware before trusting on-air behavior.
