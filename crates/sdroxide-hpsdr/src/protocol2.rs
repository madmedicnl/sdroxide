//! OpenHPSDR Protocol 2 ("new protocol") wire format: constants and pure
//! packet builders/parsers.
//!
//! Byte offsets originally came from the g0orx/rustyHPSDR reference and the
//! N4MTT "openhpsdr-e" Wireshark dissector. Every field in this file was then
//! audited against `dl1ycf/pihpsdr` — `src/new_protocol.c` and `src/alex.h` for
//! what the host writes, and `src/newhpsdrsim.c`, which is the *radio* side and
//! therefore says what each byte is read back as. That is the reference to
//! reach for: it is more precise than the PDF spec and it is what the boards
//! are tested against.
//!
//! What the audit found, all of it silent — well-formed packets a board
//! accepts and acts on wrongly, never an error:
//!
//! - The transmit stream is fed at **192 kHz**, not Protocol 1's 48 kHz
//!   ([`crate::TX_RATE_HZ_P2`], issue #440). Starving it four to one leaves a
//!   carrier untouched and chops speech to pieces.
//! - The open-collector byte is **1401**, not 1400 ([`HP_OC`], issue #438).
//!   1400 is a real neighbouring field, so the word was accepted and switched
//!   nothing.
//! - The **Alex control words** (1428/1432) were never sent, so a board with an
//!   internal filter chain was told to release every relay — no transmit path,
//!   no antenna, no filter. See [`alex_words`].
//! - The two-ADC boards were recognised by a name **no board ever reports**, so
//!   a Saturn or ANAN-7000 was told in its General packet that it had one Alex
//!   chain.
//! - The DUC command declared **zero DACs** ([`duc_command_packet`]).
//!
//! Cross-checked but still not hardware-verified here: the DDC frequency
//! stride, the Alex bit assignments, and everything the notes on individual
//! builders call out.
