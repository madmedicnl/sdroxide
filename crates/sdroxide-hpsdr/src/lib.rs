//! Native OpenHPSDR (ethernet SDR) support — **Protocol 1 and Protocol 2**.
//!
//! NATIVE ONLY. Pure-Rust UDP; this crate must never be a dependency of any
//! wasm-targeted crate (mirrors the `sdroxide-cat` invariant). It is reached
//! only from the root binary and `local_controller.rs`; the settings UI talks to
//! it exclusively through the `RadioController` trait.
//!
//! Discovery probes for both protocols and each board is driven by the one it
//! answers on: Protocol 1 (Metis framing — Hermes-Lite 2 and the legacy
//! Metis/Hermes boards) or Protocol 2. The two live in sibling framing modules
//! behind the same discovery + [`HpsdrBoard`] abstraction: one connection per
//! board, one [`HpsdrRx`] stream per DDC — a Protocol 2 board serves several
//! radios from one connection, each on its own independently tuned DDC, while
//! Protocol 1 carries exactly one. The transmitter (DUC) belongs to DDC 0's
//! stream.
