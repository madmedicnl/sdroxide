# QO-100 quick-start (sdroxide + ADALM-Pluto)

A task-oriented walkthrough for getting an **ADALM-Pluto** + **Ku-band LNB**
station onto the QO-100 (Es'hail-2) geostationary transponder with sdroxide. It
covers the one-time station setup, locking onto the bird, and the QO-100
beacon-sync tab. For the reference detail behind each control, see
[`USER_MANUAL.md`](USER_MANUAL.md) §2.22 (QO-100 beacon plugin) and §6.2.7
(PlutoSDR).

The 10 GHz downlink comes down through the LNB; the 2.4 GHz uplink leaves the
Pluto directly.

## What you need

- **ADALM-Pluto** (or a LibreSDR / ANTSDR-class AD936x board).
- A universal **Ku-band LNB** with a **9750 MHz** local oscillator — the usual
  QO-100 choice.
- A dish, the coax from the LNB, and a 2.4 GHz uplink antenna.
- **sdroxide** installed. The Pluto driver is built in; there is nothing else to
  install.

## The frequency chain

```
downlink   10489.750 MHz --> LNB (LO 9750 MHz) --> 739.750 MHz --> Pluto
uplink      2400.xxx MHz <-- Pluto (direct, not converted)
```

Bold names such as **Converter** are buttons and fields exactly as they appear on
screen. `Settings > Radio` is a menu path; `192.168.2.1` is a value you type.

## Part A — Settings

Done once and saved. Everything is in the **Settings** window, on the **General**
and **Radio** tabs.

### 1. Start sdroxide

Open the program. The main window has the control bar across the top and the
panadapter and waterfall below it.

### 2. Open the settings

Press **SETTINGS** on the top control bar.

### 3. Callsign and locator

On the **General** tab, enter your callsign in **Callsign** and your Maidenhead
grid (e.g. `KN41GG`) in **Locator**. The satellite lock and the world map use
this locator — **LOCK ON** will not work without it.

### 4. Radio tab — device: PlutoSDR

Switch to the **Radio** tab and pick **PlutoSDR** in the interface selector. A
Pluto is a network device even on a USB cable: plugging it in creates a network
adapter, not a serial port. The next five fields are on this same tab:

![Settings, Radio tab: Interface, Converter, Offset, Transmit, Address, Sample rate and Apply](images/qo100-quickstart/03-settings-radio.en.png)

### 5. Converter: LNB, Ku low (-9750 MHz)

In the **Converter** dropdown, pick the **LNB, Ku low (-9750 MHz)** preset —
because our LNBs have a 9750 MHz local oscillator. This fills in the
`-9 750 000 000 Hz` offset below automatically, so the 10489.750 MHz beacon lands
near the right place on the dial.

### 6. Transmit row: Its own offset = 0

In the **Transmit** row next to the converter offset, choose **Its own offset**
and type `0` into the Hz box beside it.

There is no need to enter a TX figure such as 8085 MHz the way we used to. This
`0` means "the downlink comes through the LNB, but the 2.4 GHz uplink leaves the
radio directly — the transmit side is not converted". If you later find your TX
frequency is off, correct it from this box (in Hz, same sign rule as the receive
offset).

### 7. Pluto address

In the connection section below, type the Pluto's IP into **Address**, or let
**Discover** find it. Over USB, `192.168.2.1` is enough. On a LAN, use the
Pluto's address on that network. `ip:192.168.2.1` is also accepted; an address
starting with `usb:` is refused, because this backend reaches the radio over the
network the USB cable already provides.

### 8. Sample rate and Full duplex

Set **Sample rate** to `1 Msps` and tick **Full duplex** below it, so you keep
hearing your own downlink while transmitting.

> **Note.** **Full duplex** only works over real Ethernet — a Pluto or LibreSDR
> behind a gigabit adapter. Over USB the station is half-duplex and you will not
> hear your own downlink during an over. Also, a stock Pluto cannot go below
> about 2.084 Msps; a lower value is rounded up and the connection message says
> so.

### 9. Apply and close

Press **Apply** at the bottom and close the **Settings** window. Settings take
effect on Apply / reconnect.

## Part B — Locking onto the satellite

Done each time you work the bird.

### 10. Open the SAT window

Press **SAT** in the System box. The button glows green while a lock is running;
the correction keeps being applied even with the window closed.

![Pressing SAT in the System box opens the SAT window](images/qo100-quickstart/04-sat-window-open.en.png)

### 11. Pick QO-100

On the **SATELLITES** tab, type `QO-100` into the search box and pick it from the
list. Its published links (narrowband transponder, beacon) appear below.

![The SATELLITES tab: search box, satellite list with QO-100 selected, TUNE and LOCK ON](images/qo100-quickstart/05-sat-satellites.en.png)

### 12. LOCK ON

Press **LOCK ON** at the bottom. QO-100 is geostationary, so it needs no Doppler
correction; the transponder mapping derives the 2.4 GHz uplink from wherever you
set the downlink dial.

---

## Part C — Beacon sync

Optional but recommended. If your LNB is not very stable, the QO-100 beacon-sync
plugin (contributed by the ATÖLYE group) measures where the 10489.750 MHz
narrowband beacon really is, corrects the converter/LNB offset so the dial and
the signal agree, and keeps correcting it as the LNB warms up and drifts.

### 13. Switch to the QO-100 tab

It is the second tab of the SAT window.

> **Prerequisite.** The plugin corrects a *residual* error of a few kHz to tens
> of kHz — it does not guess from scratch. The `Settings > Radio` converter
> offset has to be roughly right first (step 5), so the beacon lands somewhere
> near 10489.750 MHz.

![The QO-100 tab: ON / TELEMETRY / AUTO, the mini waterfall with the beacon's two lobes, the TRACKER/CONVERTER OFFSET/MEASURED readouts, and APPLY CORRECTION](images/qo100-quickstart/06-sat-qo100-tracker.en.png)

### 14. See the beacon in the strip

If the beacon is not visible as a band / two symmetric lobes, step **width** up
with **+** (±5 kHz steps, up to ±50 kHz). Widen only until the two lobes and the
null between them are clear, then bring it back toward ±5 kHz.

### 15. Still nothing: nudge 9750 by hand

Nudge the 9750 MHz converter offset in `Settings > Radio` to an approximate value
in the right direction and press **Apply**; repeat until the beacon is inside the
strip. The plugin takes it from there.

### 16. Simple (one-shot) correction

**Double-click** the middle of the beacon in the strip. That plants a "the beacon
is here" mark (the two lobes, centred on the null). Then press
**APPLY CORRECTION** at the bottom. The receiver reopens on the corrected offset
and the beacon jumps toward the centre. Two passes — one wide (coarse), one
narrow (fine) — get it within a few hundred Hz.

### 17. Automatic, continuous correction

Press **ON** (the spectral tracker starts — it only *measures*, it changes
nothing), then **AUTO** (the loop closes: every clean, steady measurement is
applied as a slow, rate-limited nudge to the offset).

AUTO then corrects LNB drift in the background. A single noisy reading never
yanks the receiver; it takes a run of agreeing measurements to move the offset.
No correction is made *while you are transmitting* — each one reopens the
receiver, which would cut off your over — so a held-back correction goes out as
soon as the over ends. AUTO also watches its own work and switches itself off if
the offset it writes does not move the beacon, or if it has gone further than any
LNB could plausibly be out by, with a notice saying which.

### 18. Telemetry (optional)

Press **TELEMETRY** to run the AO-40 frame decoders; the beacon's own status
text appears when it locks. Not needed for calibration — it is an independent
check.

### 19. Leave it running in the background

When you are done, minimise this window and keep it in a corner of the screen
(closing it is fine too). The LNB correction keeps going with the window closed;
the **SAT** chip stays lit and the QO-100 tab keeps its dot.

![The QO-100 panel left floating in a corner of the main window while AUTO keeps correcting](images/qo100-quickstart/07-main-window-mini-panel.en.png)

Good QSOs, and 73.
