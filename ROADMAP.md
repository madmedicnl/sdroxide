# ROADMAP — SDR Oxide, the SWL edition

What this fork is for: turning sdroxide's receiver into the best **shortwave
listening** program it can be — no licence, no callsign, no transmitting unless
asked for. This file is the plan; it changes as the fork teaches us what
matters.

Ordered by value to a listener, not by effort. Each phase is meant to stand on
its own.

## Phase 1 — the listener's identity

**Done.** **SWL mode** now hides the transmit controls *and* swaps the
DX-cluster/POTA/SOTA spots and the awards for the listener's windows, a
**LISTEN window** with the
SWL reception log — station, frequency, UTC, mode, language, **SINPO or SIO**,
S-meter, notes — and a **REPORT** button that writes the entry as a reception
report to send to the broadcaster. The log lives in `swl_log.json`, its own
file, and records what was *heard* rather than worked.

The goal it was built for: opening the program should feel like a listener's
radio, not a transceiver with the transmit parts hidden.

- **Listener profile.** One setting that sets SWL mode and Simple UI, and hides
  the ham *receive* chrome that means nothing to a listener — awards
  (DXCC/WAS/WAZ), the DX-cluster/POTA/SOTA spots, QSL uploads — replacing them
  with station, schedule and propagation.
- **SWL listening log.** A log that records what was *heard*, not what was
  worked: station (from the schedule where known), frequency, UTC, mode,
  **SINPO/SIO**, language, programme notes, and an S-meter reading.
- **Reception report.** Generate a ready-to-send report for a station
  (station, date/time UTC, frequency, SINPO, receiver/antenna), the way SWLs
  report to broadcasters.

## Phase 2 — the broadcast schedule (the centrepiece)

**Almost done.** The **SCHEDULE window** browses the EiBi table: filter by a
chosen UTC time (or now), by metre band, language and target, and by free text
over name/site/country/language/target. A row can be **TUNE**d, or **LOG**ged
straight into the reception log with the station, language and site filled in.

**Complete.** Favourites are in: a row carries a star, starred stations are kept
by name in `broadcast_favourites.json`, and a **★ FAVS** filter shows only them
— tied to the station rather than to a bare frequency.

## Phase 3 — listening tools

- **Time-shift buffer / instant replay.** **Done** — a rolling two-minute window
  (mono, ~23 MB per receiver) and a **REPLAY** control in the LISTEN window: a
  DVR two minutes behind live. The CAT-audio path is not covered yet.
- **Scheduled recordings.** **Done** — a job is a start time, a frequency, a
  mode, a duration and what to capture (audio / I/Q / both); the RECORDINGS
  window lists and edits them, and a scheduler runs the engine's recorder. The
  filename is the engine's own for now; naming it after the station is a
  follow-up.
- **ECSS.** **Done** — two one-sided SAM presets, ECSS-U and ECSS-L, that keep
  one sideband and reject the other: the medium-wave DX trick for ducking an
  adjacent channel. Deliberately on SAM alone; AM and C-QUAM would not honour
  it.
- **Listener audio chain.** **Tone done** — a low-shelf / peak / high-shelf on
  the demodulated audio, in front of the speakers, edited in the LISTEN window.
  Noise reduction aimed at broadcast rather than speech is still open; the
  bandwidth side is the existing filter.

## Phase 4 — polish

- **UTC first**: **UTC clock** in the SCHEDULE and LISTEN windows, where a
  listener works. A general "UTC everywhere" pass is still open.
- **Utility labels**: **Done** — a built-in table (time signals WWV/WWVH, CHU,
  RWM, BPM; Shannon/RAF/New York VOLMET; the Buzzer), merged into every loaded
  schedule so they get the same labels and can be starred and logged.
- **Band naming**: **Done** — the band chip names the metre band on shortwave
  ("SW 49m · AM") and the band/mode menu offers the metre bands as shortcuts,
  from one table shared with the schedule's filter.
- **Band scanning for listeners**: **Done** — a Broadcast band row in the
  scanner (LW, MW and every metre band as one-click ranges), and the status
  line names the station it stops on.
- **DRM for the listener**: the programme label and scrolling text are already
  decoded and shown. The **MOT slideshow** is the part left: the vendored Dream
  decoder compiles the MOT and Journaline classes but the Rust shim only
  surfaces the label and text, so it needs the shim extended (C++ + FFI + a
  panel) and a real signal with a slideshow to validate. The largest remaining
  item.
- **HD Radio (NRSC-5) for the listener.** **FM done** — the digital sidecar of
  an FM broadcast is a `Mode`, decoded by the vendored nrsc5 receiver and heard
  through the ordinary audio path, with an HD Radio panel showing sync, both
  sidebands' MER, CBER, the programme and the station's own name, slogan and
  message (issue #437). Needs a front end capturing roughly ±200 kHz around the
  carrier — a complex rate of about 1 Msps or more. The **AM-band variant** (HD
  on medium wave) is open: the decoder wants opening in its AM mode and feeding
  at 46,511.71875 S/s, which the engine would choose from the dial frequency.
  The **HD-2/HD-3 subchannel** chips and the **album art / PSD** the multiplex
  can carry are further open work.

## Not goals

- **Transmitting.** SWL mode is the default; there is no push to make transmit
  first-class here. It stays available for anyone who wants it, behind the
  upstream lockouts.
- **Ham operating aids.** Awards, contesting and QSL chasing are upstream's and
  stay read-only-or-hidden.
- **The CB band.** This fork grew out of the CB/SWL fork and still carries its
  11 m work; it is not the focus here and may be retired or hidden as the
  listener features take over.

## Relationship to upstream

Seeded from the CB/SWL fork (`madmedicnl/sdroxide`), which is a fork of
`dividebysandwich/sdroxide`. Upstream changes are merged in periodically; a
feature that is useful to *anyone* (not just listeners) is a candidate to offer
upstream as a pull request rather than keep here.
